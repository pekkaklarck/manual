# Robot Framework API

Robot Framework's primary public API is exposed via these modules:

  * [robot.api][]: The main stable API.
  * [robot.run][]: Entry points for executing tests or tasks.
  * [robot.rebot][]: Entry points for post-processing outputs (Rebot).
  * [robot.libdoc][]: Entry points for the Libdoc tool.

You may sometimes need to import items also from other modules, for example
to be able to use them in type hints, but that should be relatively rare.

!!! warning

    API docs are not rendered properly, because they are written using reStructuredText
    that is not supported on this platform. They will be converted to Markdown after
    this Manual has been moved under the core Robot Framework repository.

    To see how API docs will look after conversion, see the [robot.run][]
    module that has already been converted.
