# Robot Framework Manual

## What is Robot Framework?  :simple-robotframework:

Robot Framework® is a generic open source automation framework for acceptance testing,
behavior-driven development (BDD) and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple
[plain text syntax][data], and it can be [extended][extending-robot-framework]
easily with generic and custom [libraries][].

Robot Framework is operating system and application independent. It is implemented
using Python which is also the primary language to extend it. The framework has
a rich ecosystem around it consisting of various generic libraries and tools that
are developed as separate projects. For more information about Robot Framework and
the ecosystem, see https://robotframework.org.
